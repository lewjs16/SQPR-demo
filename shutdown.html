    In honor of #ShutDownSTEM, I want to express my thoughts on the subject of racial justice and the role that the STEM field must play in order to ensure that minority voices are heard. 
</p>

<p>
    Scientific goals and community issues seem largely dissonant in the context of daily research. We are encouraged to keep our observations focused on the measurable, but in reality, the physical and social worlds are not separable. Every calculation is performed by an individual who has their own footprint in society, and to suggest that we can completely set aside our implicit biases when we enter the academic environment is ignorant at best. It is important to recognize the current shortcomings of the STEM field structure so that we can aim to be a more inclusive environment in the future. 
</p>

<p>
    I am alarmed by the persistent lack of diversity in STEM. Only about 1 in 6 Black, Hispanic, or Indiginous individuals are science and engineering workers despite composing a third of the US population. This is a sad reflection of the current STEM climate that keeps on dismissing the importance of social identities and backgrounds. If we carry on with “business as usual,” the STEM field will continue to be complicit in the spread of systemic racism. We are not only suppressing talent, but also hindering the overall progression of science by limiting perspectives to problem solving. If we had encouraged diversity in STEM, we could have avoided disastrous facial recognition technology that cannot work with certain skin colors, or machine learning algorithms that see patterns with race that are not really there. 
</p>

<p>
    As an undergraduate student, it pains me to see the effects of inequity already emerging in my courses. I have heard stories- and experienced- hostile environments perpetuated by a lack of awareness of racial and ethnic issues not only amongst peers, but also with faculty in leadership positions. What hurts the most is hearing individuals who believe that the college is already trying its best to help students. If this is the best, then I am not optimistic about the future. 
</p>

<p>
    I think that the #ShutDownSTEM movement has been an amazing opportunity to examine racial issues, but I hope that the conversation does not stop at the end of today. Discussion is important, but actions speak louder than words, so I hope that the dialogue that we had in lab meetings or with peers translates to real, sustainable change. We cannot flip a switch and hope for racism to magically disappear. Rather, it is persistent effort and dedication to supporting minority voices that will lead to a more equitable future.
